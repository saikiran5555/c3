    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and K-means clustering are two popular clustering algorithms, but they differ significantly in their approach, assumptions, and the types of data they are suitable for. Here's how DBSCAN clustering differs from K-means clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN: DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together data points that are closely packed, forming high-density regions. It defines clusters as areas of the dataset where there are many data points within a specified distance (epsilon, ε) of each other. It does not require the user to specify the number of clusters beforehand and can identify clusters of arbitrary shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means: K-means is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions the dataset into K clusters. It aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their respective cluster centroids. K-means requires the user to specify the number of clusters (K) in advance and assumes that clusters are isotropic (spherical) and of similar size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster Shape:\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN: DBSCAN can identify clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes. It is robust to outliers and noise and can handle clusters with varying densities. DBSCAN is suitable for datasets with complex cluster structures and irregularly shaped clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means: K-means assumes that clusters are isotropic (spherical) and of similar size. It is sensitive to outliers and noise and struggles with clusters of non-convex shapes or varying densities. K-means may produce suboptimal results for datasets with complex cluster structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Clusters:\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN: DBSCAN does not require the user to specify the number of clusters beforehand. It automatically detects clusters based on density and can identify the optimal number of clusters from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means: K-means requires the user to specify the number of clusters (K) in advance. The choice of K significantly impacts the clustering results, and selecting an inappropriate value of K may lead to suboptimal clustering outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Noise:\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN: DBSCAN can identify and classify outliers or noise points as data points that do not belong to any cluster. It distinguishes between core points (dense regions), border points (within ε-distance of core points), and noise points (isolated points).\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means: K-means does not explicitly handle noise or outliers. Outliers may influence the position of cluster centroids and affect the clustering results. K-means may assign outliers to the nearest cluster, potentially leading to inaccurate clustering outcomes."
